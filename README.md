# EliteProspecting 2


Elite-Prospecting is design for miners and wing miners to help you prospecting.
It shows you (and your wing mates) the content of your prospector limpet only if above your threshold


Usage
--------
Launch Elite Dangerous First !
then Launch EliteProspecting2

If you want to see your friend's prospector, change the room from default to something else (you and our friends need to use the same). Then click save settings and go online

About messages colors :
You can use a string specifying the proportion of red, green and blue in hexadecimal digits. For example, "#fff" is white, "#000000" is black, "#00ff00" is pure green, and "#00ffff" is pure cyan (green plus blue).
You can also use any locally defined standard color name. The colors "white", "black", "red", "green", "blue", "cyan", "yellow", and "magenta" will always be available.

Transparency only work on windows
(sorry fellow linux users) ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

use server.py if you want to run your own server !
remove conf.ini, to revert to default settings :)

Installation
--------
Download the `.zip` file [here](https://github.com/Arkhchance/EliteProspecting2/releases/latest)

Extract the content, run (after elite!)

if you're under linux, you need python3, then pip install pyzmq playsound
and clone the repo, edit journal.py to match your journal's location, I'll automate it in a future release
